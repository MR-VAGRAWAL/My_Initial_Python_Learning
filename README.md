# My_Initial_Python_Learning
It contains the list of some codes which is of basics of python.
It will help us to revise our some basics content of python.
It will also build our logical thinking.
I wrote these codes in such a way which will enable us to recall the manner in which we have to assign variable and perform coding.
This is just for the learning purpose.
Thankyou.....
